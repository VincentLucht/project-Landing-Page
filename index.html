            I only dabbled into the JavaScript basics, when I did the Free Coding Camp curriculum,
            but I didn't really like their teaching style. You hade to code something and then 
            it was corrected by a bot, but I really liked how they explained the fundamentals.
            Continuing with The Odin Project, I really hope to learn a lot of JavaScript.

            A simple but strong programming language, or should I say markup language? 
            Due to learning a lot of Python, I quickly learned its Syntax and it is quite easy.
            This is my first actual project from scratch using HTML, and I like it. 
            Sometimes, creating divs for CSS flexbox is a little bit difficult, but I managed
            until now.

            A not so simple, but very strong programming language, I mean Style Sheet language.
            At first, CSS was quite easy, but it quickly became rather complex with Flexbox,
            but I am starting to become proficient with Flexbox. Of course, this is also my 
            first project from scratch.

            Due to CS50x, I had to start with C. I don't really like it, due to its verbosity
            and all its low-level abstractions. I only did the CS50x projects, nothing more.
