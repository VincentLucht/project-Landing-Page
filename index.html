            and all its low-level abstractions. I only did the CS50x projects, nothing more.

          When I was really young, I had access to a phone and I was instantly hooked to the
          Internet. I always wondered how it worked and how to make a website, but I always 
          and thought: "It's to complicated for me anyway" and pushed it away. 
          <br><br>
          After graduating from high school, I wondered what I should do now, and then
          bam: I saw a video about a programming course called "CS50x" and that it is 
          from Harvard and completely free? I was baffled, and immediately signed up and 
          started it. It was a grueling process, but I managed my way trough it. 
          <br><br>
          It was difficult, but I only learned the fundamentals from it, and I jumped to 
          another course from Dr. Angela Yu, where I became very proficient with Python.
          But I also wanted to learn web development, so that I could display all my projects
          on cool websites, but Python couldn't do that and them bam! - I found out about 
          the incredible (and free) "The Odin Project", which is what I am currently doing!
